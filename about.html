<h3>The purpouse of this project</h3> 

<pre> <font face="verdana">  
In the modern day civilization, offering various types of data to a user remains crucial concerning any significant company.
However, presenting this data in a suitable and visually appealing way can be a challenge for any organization. 
The overall purpose of this project is to display data from the World Health Organisation towards the user within a much 
more convenient and accessible way. The target audience in this situation would be people interested in specific data of 
health concerning a country or their society in a much faster way. Moreover, let us assume an audience member is drawn in 
or concerned about, for example, the suicide rates of teenagers in the current society. To access this data, the audience
member would have to scroll through a dozen lines of data presented in an inconvenient and non visually appealing 
arrangement. Therefore, if we display the dozens of data in a simple and accessible way such as a pie chart, the user would
not have to progress through the strain of obtaining these relevant data. We will construct these graphs using HTML5 
canvas which lets us view data using various types of graphs.</font></pre>
 

<h3>Justified changes to my design</h3> 
<pre> <font face="verdana">    
During the period between <a href="dev.html">Developing Ideas</a></p> and creating the solution, 
I have made some minor changes towards my design mainly due to time restrictions. </font></pre>

<pre> <font face="verdana"> 
Firstly, I had multiple bars in my graph to represent data for one country, in contrast to the one bar of data shown to compare to the other graphs. 
I did this because I want the user to have as much data as they can for the country whereas just having one bar of data. One positive about this is 
that it classifies the data by the periods of time, giving the user more information on the malaria deaths in the country. However, one negative 
aspect of this is that I cannot compare one countries data to another countrys data, this leads on to my second point. </font></pre>
    
<pre> <font face="verdana"> 
Secondly, I could not have different bar charts to compare the countries due mainly to time restrictions as well. I created another canvas with all
the same data however this did not to seem to work as the two different pulldowns overlap with each other. This would have been good so the user 
could compare the two countries data to each other. </font></pre>
    
<pre> <font face="verdana"> 
Furthermore, I added the years to the bottom of the bar graph which I found quite unique to other bar charts within the class. I did this because, 
while the user cannot compare other countries to each other, they can compare the different time periods of the country. </font></pre>

<pre> <font face="verdana"> 
Lastly, I improved the CSS of the website by a large amount to my earlier designs. I added this addition because I want to display data in a 
visually appealing way to the user so it looks more professional. Usually, If the user sees a dull looking website, It would look unprofessional
therefore the user would click away. I would want to make my data look professional so it is presented as more reliable. </font></pre>
