   In the modern day civilization, offering various types of data to a user remains crucial concerning any significant 
   company. However, presenting this data in a suitable and visually appealing way can be a challenge for any organization. 
   The overall purpose of this project is to display data from the World Health Organisation towards the user within a much 
   more convenient and accessible way. The target audience in this situation would be people interested in specific data of 
   health concerning a country or their society in a much faster way. Moreover, let us assume an audience member is drawn in 
   or concerned about, for example, the suicide rates of teenagers in the current society. To access this data, the audience
   member would have to scroll through a dozen lines of data presented in an inconvenient and non visually appealing 
   arrangement. Therefore, if we display the dozens of data in a simple and accessible way such as a pie chart, the user would
   not have to progress through the strain of obtaining these relevant data. We will construct these graphs using HTML5 canvas
   which lets us view data using various types of graphs.
