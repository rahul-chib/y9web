<h1 style="font-family:roboto;">Developing Ideas</h1>
  <h2 style="font-family:roboto;">Introduction</h2>
  <p>In the modern day civilization, offering various types of data to a user remains crucial concerning any significant company. However, presenting this data in a suitable and visually appealing way can be a challenge for any organization. The overall purpose of this project is to display data from the World Health Organisation towards the user within a much more convenient and accessible way. The target audience in this situation would be people interested in specific data of health concerning a country or their society in a much faster way. Moreover, let us assume an audience member is drawn in or concerned about, for example, the suicide rates of teenagers in the current society. To access this data, the audience member would have to scroll through a dozen lines of data presented in an inconvenient and non visually appealing arrangement. Therefore, if we display the dozens of data in a simple and accessible way such as a pie chart, the user would not have to progress through the strain of obtaining these relevant data. We will construct these graphs using HTML5 canvas which lets us view data using various types of graphs.

  <h2 style="font-family:roboto;">Design Specifications</h2>
  <p>
     So far, I have analyzed through 3 different websites that all used HTML5 and canvas however they all displayed data in different ways. One presented in a pie chart form (https://canvasjs.com/javascript-charts/animated-chart/), one in a line graph form (https://www.chartjs.org/samples/latest/charts/line/basic.html) and finally one in a bar graph form ( https://www.koolchart.com/demo/bar-chart). The purpose of this was to display data from the World Health Organisation towards the user within a much more convenient and accessible way. The target audience in this situation would be people interested in specific data of health concerning a country or their society in a much faster way. Overall, in my research I have found that to display data using HTML5 canvas, the website needs the following elements in order to be successful:
   </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Include the format of the line chart HTML canvas since it is the most visually appealing and is great for comparisons
</li>
  <li> I would make a large scale website and HTML5 canvas so the user gets a better view of the smaller lines of data
</li>
  <li>Spread out each of the data lines as you add more data since the line charts becoming messy and overlapping too much is a common problem
</li>
   <li>All the websites I analyzed had the feature that if the user hovers their mouse over the data chart, it displays data. However, this is only for a certain month not allowing the user to access that much data. However, for my data chart, I want that if you hover your mouse at any part of the line, it displays the data allowing the user to access more data.
</li>
  <li>Furthermore, I would have a clear color key showing the user which type of data is being presented
</li>
	<li>Moreover, I would like to present my data on how it has changed over a certain time period to show the user how their data has improved or decreased
</li>
	<li>Finally, I would like the overall data chart to be user-friendly by not having any untrustworthy data and a visually appealing chart to display the data
</li>
