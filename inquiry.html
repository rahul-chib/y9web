<h2 style="font-family:roboto;">The Range of products/websites</h2>
  <p><a href="https://canvasjs.com/javascript-charts/animated-chart/">First website (Pie chart)</a></p>
	<p> This website shows one of the various ways to graphically display data using HTML5 canvas, a pie chart. </p>
	<p>Pros: This way to display data succeeds in various ways. First of all, the overall look of the pie chart is visually appealing, therefore, this will get the user more engaged with the data being presented. Moreover, the pie chart has a clear use of a color key at the bottom which distinctly shows the user what specific data is being presented in each different color, giving a more comfortable and simple feeling to the chart.  Furthermore, each segment of the circle is of different size depending on the size of data. This presents the user with a rough estimate of the data with the naked eye (this does label the specific data along with the chart), along with a comparison of all the data. This allows the user to compare crucial data with other data which can be very helpful concerning what type of data you are displaying. Finally, as the user hovers over a segment of the data with their mouse, the canvas display’s the data for the user. This is very convenient for the user as it is crucial for graphically displayed charts to clearly present their data for the user.
	<p>Cons: Although a pie chart is a very convenient and user-friendly way to display data, there are some negative aspects to it. Firstly, the colors used to display data are quite bland, therefore, at first glance can be quite non-visually appealing leading to dissatisfaction from the user. Secondly, the smaller data presented in a segment of a pie chart can be very hard to see as it is lost between the other larger segments. This is a disadvantage for the user as it is difficult to compare data to one another. Furthermore, the overall pie chart is quite small, therefore, this can be hard for the user to read the data. To fix this, I would make the pie chart bigger and make the headings a little smaller as the data is the most crucial part of the chart.
	


  <p><a href="https://www.chartjs.org/samples/latest/charts/line/basic.html">Second website (Line graph)</a></p>
	<p> This website shows one of the various ways to graphically display data using HTML5 canvas, a line graph. </p>
	<p> Pros:This way to display data benefits the user in several ways. Firstly, the look of the line chart is aesthetically pleasing, hence, this will get the user further interested in the data being displayed. Furthermore, the line graph produces a distinct use of a color key at the top of the chart which presents the user with specific data in two different colors, giving a more manageable feeling to the chart, further engaging the user to this critical data.  Moreover, compared to the bland colors of the first website, the colors used are much more neon and bright, presenting the user with a more comfortable website. Furthermore, each line in the chart is next to each other and overlapping one another, this (similarly with the first website) shows a comparison of all the data. This provides the user to compare vital data with the other lines which can be quite significant considering what sort of data you are presenting. Moreover, as the user hovers over a dot in the line of the data with their mouse, the canvas display’s the data from the two lines for the user. This is very helpful for the user as it is important for graphically displayed charts to clearly exhibit their data for the user. Furthermore, this line graph shows how the data progresses over a certain amount of time, this shows the user how much their specific data has increased or, in some cases, impact a country/region. This contrasts to the pie chart which only shows one specific time of data. Finally, at the bottom of the graph, there is an option to add, remove and randomize all the data. This can be very helpful to the user if they just want to compare two lines from one another if there are multiple lines or focus on one line of data without the other lines overlapping it. This feature was lacking in the first chart.

<h2 style="font-family:roboto;">Solution and purpouse</h2>
<p>In the modern day civilization, offering various types of data to a user remains crucial concerning 
	any significant company. However, presenting this data in a suitable and visually appealing way can be a challenge 
	for any organization. The overall purpose of this project is to display data from the World Health Organisation towards
	the user within a much more convenient and accessible way. The target audience in this situation would be people 
	interested in specific data of health concerning a country or their society in a much faster way. Moreover, 
	let us assume an audience member is drawn in or concerned about, for example, the suicide rates of teenagers 
	in the current society. To access this data, the audience member would have to scroll through a dozen lines of 
	data presented in an inconvenient and non visually appealing arrangement. Therefore, if we display the dozens 
	of data in a simple and accessible way such as a pie chart, the user would not have to progress through the 
	strain of obtaining this relevant data. We will construct these graphs using HTML5 canvas which lets us view 
	data using various types of graphs.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:roboto;">Research plan</h2>
 <p>To make sure the user has accessible and relevant data, we must understand the basics the language HTML5 canvas which is
	 the building blocks to produce shapes and different charts to present data. Furthermore, we also need to know the 
	 different types of charts we can use using HTML5 canvas, therefore, I have chosen to analyse 3 websites using HTML5 
	 canvas to construct different types of data charts to graphically display data. Moreover, I will also have to point 
	 out the similarities between the three websites however also point out some pros and cons. Finally, I will choose what
	 aspects from each website that I want to use when I am displaying my data from the World Health Organisation then 
	 create a design breif summarizing my findings on HTML5 canvas. Overall, we are analysing different ways of graphically 
	 displaying data to ensure that we provide the user with visually apealling and convinient data charts. </p>
