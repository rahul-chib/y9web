<h2 style="font-family:roboto;">Solution and purpouse</h2>
<p>In the modern day civilization, offering various types of data to a user remains crucial concerning 
	any significant company. However, presenting this data in a suitable and visually appealing way can be a challenge 
	for any organization. The overall purpose of this project is to display data from the World Health Organisation towards
	the user within a much more convenient and accessible way. The target audience in this situation would be people 
	interested in specific data of health concerning a country or their society in a much faster way. Moreover, 
	let us assume an audience member is drawn in or concerned about, for example, the suicide rates of teenagers 
	in the current society. To access this data, the audience member would have to scroll through a dozen lines of 
	data presented in an inconvenient and non visually appealing arrangement. Therefore, if we display the dozens 
	of data in a simple and accessible way such as a pie chart, the user would not have to progress through the 
	strain of obtaining this relevant data. We will construct these graphs using HTML5 canvas which lets us view 
	data using various types of graphs.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:roboto;">Research plan</h2>
 <p>To make sure the user has accessible and relevant data, we must understand the basics the language HTML5 canvas which is
	 the building blocks to produce shapes and different charts to present data. Furthermore, we also need to know the 
	 different types of charts we can use using HTML5 canvas, therefore, I have chosen to analyse 3 websites using HTML5 
	 canvas to construct different types of data charts to graphically display data. Moreover, I will also have to point 
	 out the similarities between the three websites however also point out some pros and cons. Finally, I will choose what
	 aspects from each website that I want to use when I am displaying my data from the World Health Organisation then 
	 create a design breif summarizing my findings on HTML5 canvas. </p>
