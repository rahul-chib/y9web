<h1 style="font-family:roboto;">Inquiry and analysis</h1>
<h2 style="font-family:roboto;">First Product</h2>
  <p><a href="https://canvasjs.com/javascript-charts/animated-chart/">First website (Pie chart)</a></p>
	<p> This website shows one of the various ways to graphically display data using HTML5 canvas, a pie chart. </p>
	<p>Pros: This way to display data succeeds in various ways. First of all, the overall look of the pie chart is visually appealing, therefore, this will get the user more engaged with the data being presented. Moreover, the pie chart has a clear use of a color key at the bottom which distinctly shows the user what specific data is being presented in each different color, giving a more comfortable and simple feeling to the chart.  Furthermore, each segment of the circle is of different size depending on the size of data. This presents the user with a rough estimate of the data with the naked eye (this does label the specific data along with the chart), along with a comparison of all the data. This allows the user to compare crucial data with other data which can be very helpful concerning what type of data you are displaying. Finally, as the user hovers over a segment of the data with their mouse, the canvas display’s the data for the user. This is very convenient for the user as it is crucial for graphically displayed charts to clearly present their data for the user.
	<p>Cons: Although a pie chart is a very convenient and user-friendly way to display data, there are some negative aspects to it. Firstly, the colors used to display data are quite bland, therefore, at first glance can be quite non-visually appealing leading to dissatisfaction from the user. Secondly, the smaller data presented in a segment of a pie chart can be very hard to see as it is lost between the other larger segments. This is a disadvantage for the user as it is difficult to compare data to one another. Furthermore, the overall pie chart is quite small, therefore, this can be hard for the user to read the data. To fix this, I would make the pie chart bigger and make the headings a little smaller as the data is the most crucial part of the chart.
	

<h2 style="font-family:roboto;">Second Product</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.chartjs.org/samples/latest/charts/line/basic.html">Second website (Line graph)</a></p>
	<p> This website shows one of the various ways to graphically display data using HTML5 canvas, a line graph. </p>
	<p> Pros:This way to display data benefits the user in several ways. Firstly, the look of the line chart is aesthetically pleasing, hence, this will get the user further interested in the data being displayed. Furthermore, the line graph produces a distinct use of a color key at the top of the chart which presents the user with specific data in two different colors, giving a more manageable feeling to the chart, further engaging the user to this critical data.  Moreover, compared to the bland colors of the first website, the colors used are much more neon and bright, presenting the user with a more comfortable website. Furthermore, each line in the chart is next to each other and overlapping one another, this (similarly with the first website) shows a comparison of all the data. This provides the user to compare vital data with the other lines which can be quite significant considering what sort of data you are presenting. Moreover, as the user hovers over a dot in the line of the data with their mouse, the canvas display’s the data from the two lines for the user. This is very helpful for the user as it is important for graphically displayed charts to clearly exhibit their data for the user. Furthermore, this line graph shows how the data progresses over a certain amount of time, this shows the user how much their specific data has increased or, in some cases, impact a country/region. This contrasts to the pie chart which only shows one specific time of data. Finally, at the bottom of the graph, there is an option to add, remove and randomize all the data. This can be very helpful to the user if they just want to compare two lines from one another if there are multiple lines or focus on one line of data without the other lines overlapping it. This feature was lacking in the first chart.
</p>     
	<p>Cons:Although a line graph is a very suitable way to display data, there are some negative features to it. Firstly, the user can only access the specific data each month, and not throughout the month. This is a disadvantage to the user since they cannot see how much the data was at a certain date of May or October. To fix this, I would add the feature that the first pie chart included, when the user hovers their mouse at any point in the line, the data will show. This will provide users with much more data but in a much more convenient way. Secondly, If you add too much data, all the lines will overlap with each other and the chart overall will become a mess. This makes it hard for the user to examine all the data at once therefore also creates a non visually appealing feel to the chart. To fix this, I would add a button that separates all the lines from one another, making it easier for the user to compare data as well as helps the chart look more visually appealing. 
 </p>
	<h2 style="font-family:roboto;">Third Product</h2>
	<p><a href="https://www.koolchart.com/demo/bar-chart/">Third website (Bar graph)</a></p>
        <p> This website shows one of the various ways to graphically display data using HTML5 canvas, a bar graph. </p>
	<p> Pros: This way to display data succeeds in various ways. First of all, the overall look of the bar chart is much more modern looking than the other two websites, therefore, this will get the user to feel more comfortable with the data being shown. Moreover, similarly to the line chart, this bar chart shows how certain data progresses over time, showing the user how their data has increased or decreased over time. Furthermore, a common problem in the last graph was that sometimes it could become a mess if there are too many lines of data in the chart, however, in this bar chart, the data bars are spread out so it is easier for the user to see the data clearly and to compare the data from one another with ease. Moreover, the exact data is shown on the bar charts providing the user with the exact data while showing them a rough estimate of the data using the bar chart.
 </p>
	<p>Cons: Although a bar chart is a very suitable way to display data, there are some negative features to it. Firstly, like the line graph, the user can only access the specific data each month, and not throughout the month. This is a limitation to the user since they cannot see how much the data was at a certain date of June or November. To fix this, I would add the feature that the first pie chart included when the user hovers their mouse at any point in the bar, the data will show. This will provide users with important further data through in a much more suitable way. Secondly, there is only one color used in this bar chart, therefore, there is no colour key. This could lead to confusion with the user, as usual, one color means that they are displaying data from lots of countries as it says Vancouver at the bottom, however, this bar graph is specifically for Vancouver so having one color makes does not work in this scenario. Furthermore, this also makes the bar chart look bland. Finally, for the data presented in the x-axis, the numbers have no label or units supported with it, therefore, the user will not know what data is being measured.

<h2 style="font-family:roboto;">Solution and purpouse</h2>
<p>In the modern day civilization, offering various types of data to a user remains crucial concerning 
	any significant company. However, presenting this data in a suitable and visually appealing way can be a challenge 
	for any organization. The overall purpose of this project is to display data from the World Health Organisation towards
	the user within a much more convenient and accessible way. The target audience in this situation would be people 
	interested in specific data of health concerning a country or their society in a much faster way. Moreover, 
	let us assume an audience member is drawn in or concerned about, for example, the suicide rates of teenagers 
	in the current society. To access this data, the audience member would have to scroll through a dozen lines of 
	data presented in an inconvenient and non visually appealing arrangement. Therefore, if we display the dozens 
	of data in a simple and accessible way such as a pie chart, the user would not have to progress through the 
	strain of obtaining this relevant data. We will construct these graphs using HTML5 canvas which lets us view 
	data using various types of graphs.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:roboto;">Research plan</h2>
 <p>To make sure the user has accessible and relevant data, we must understand the basics the language HTML5 canvas which is
	 the building blocks to produce shapes and different charts to present data. Furthermore, we also need to know the 
	 different types of charts we can use using HTML5 canvas, therefore, I have chosen to analyse 3 websites using HTML5 
	 canvas to construct different types of data charts to graphically display data. Moreover, I will also have to point 
	 out the similarities between the three websites however also point out some pros and cons. Finally, I will choose what
	 aspects from each website that I want to use when I am displaying my data from the World Health Organisation then 
	 create a design breif summarizing my findings on HTML5 canvas. Overall, we are analysing different ways of graphically 
	 displaying data to ensure that we provide the user with visually apealling and convinient data charts. </p>
 
	<h2 style="font-family:roboto;">Design Breif</h2>
	
	<p>Overall, I analyzed through 3 different websites that all used HTML5 and canvas however they all displayed data in different ways. One presented in a pie chart form (https://canvasjs.com/javascript-charts/animated-chart/), one in a line graph form (https://www.chartjs.org/samples/latest/charts/line/basic.html) and finally one in a bar graph form ( https://www.koolchart.com/demo/bar-chart). The purpose of this was to display data from the World Health Organisation towards the user within a much more convenient and accessible way. The target audience in this situation would be people interested in specific data of health concerning a country or their society in a much faster way. Each website has their strengths and weaknesses, however, If i take the:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>The modern look of the third website (makes the website visually aesthetically pleasing)</li>
  <li>The bright and neon colors of the second website (will make the audience more comfortable with the data)</li>
  <li>Include the format of the line chart HTML canvas since it is the most visually appealing and is great for comparisons</li>
   <li>However, I would take the scale of the second website and import that to the line chart so the user gets a better view of the smaller lines of data</li>
  <li>Spread out each of the data lines as you add more data since the line charts becoming messy and overlapping too much is a common problem</li>
	<li>All the websites had the feature that if the user hovers their mouse over the data chart, it displays data. However, this is only for a certain month not allowing the user to access that much data. However, for my data chart, I want that if you hover your mouse at any part of the line, it displays the data allowing the user to access more data. </li>
	<li>Furthermore, I would have the clear color key of the first website showing the user which type of data is being presented </li>
	<li>Moreover, like the second and third website, I would like to present my data on how it has changed over a certain time period to show the user how their data has improved or decreased</li>
	<li>Moreover, like the second and third website, I would like to present my data on how it has changed over a certain time period to show the user how their data has improved or decreased </li>
	<li>Finally, I would like the overall data chart to be user friendly by not having any untrustworthy data and a visually appealing chart to display the data </li>
	</ul>
