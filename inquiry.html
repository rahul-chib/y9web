<p>Solution and purpose: In the modern day civilization, offering various types of data to a user remains crucial concerning 
	any significant company. However, presenting this data in a suitable and visually appealing way can be a challenge 
	for any organization. The overall purpose of this project is to display data from the World Health Organisation towards
	the user within a much more convenient and accessible way. The target audience in this situation would be people 
	interested in specific data of health concerning a country or their society in a much faster way. Moreover, 
	let us assume an audience member is drawn in or concerned about, for example, the suicide rates of teenagers 
	in the current society. To access this data, the audience member would have to scroll through a dozen lines of 
	data presented in an inconvenient and non visually appealing arrangement. Therefore, if we display the dozens 
	of data in a simple and accessible way such as a pie chart, the user would not have to progress through the 
	strain of obtaining this relevant data. We will construct these graphs using HTML5 canvas which lets us view 
	data using various types of graphs.</p>
